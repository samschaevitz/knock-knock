knock-knock is the question you didn't know you wanted to ask, before you thought to ask "who's there?"

it's meant to allow closed groups of location-distributed people keep up-to-date on where everyone else has been. think of it as an inverted linkedin, where instead of asking "what's eduardo up to these days?", you can ask "has anyone been to mumbai?".
